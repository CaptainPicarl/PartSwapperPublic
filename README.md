# PartSwapperPublic

This is the public repository for my partswapper tool.
This repository will be used primarily for releases, limited sharing of project resources, and documentation via the Wiki.

Source code is manually exposed/uploaded, so it may lag behind what is in releases or my private repos.

After downloading a release, I recommend visiting the [PartSwapper Wiki](https://github.com/CaptainPicarl/PartSwapperPublic/wiki/Get-Started)
