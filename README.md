# PartSwapperPublic

This is the public repository for my partswapper tool.
This repository will be used primarily for releases, limited sharing of project resources, and documentation via the Wiki.

Source code is manually exposed/uploaded, so it may lag behind what is in releases compared to my private repos.

For an overview of PartSwapper, as well as instructions on how to get started - I recommend visiting the [PartSwapper Wiki.](https://github.com/CaptainPicarl/PartSwapperPublic/wiki/Get-Started)
